## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Market Opportunity

The global options market exceeds $50 trillion in notional value, yet remains largely inaccessible to retail traders due to:
- High barriers to entry and complex broker requirements
- Limited trading hours (traditional markets close)
- Expensive fees and margin requirements
- Lack of transparency in pricing and execution
- Geographic restrictions and regulatory limitations

Simultaneously, algorithmic trading represents 70%+ of traditional market volume but requires significant infrastructure investment and technical expertise.

### 1.2 The Optimic Solution

Optimic democratizes access to sophisticated derivatives trading by building a blockchain-native infrastructure that combines:
- **Options Trading**: Complete options chains with all standard and exotic strategies
- **Algorithmic Trading**: On-chain strategy execution and backtesting
- **Market Making**: Decentralized liquidity provision with automated risk management
- **Cross-Asset Arbitrage**: Native support for multi-asset strategies
